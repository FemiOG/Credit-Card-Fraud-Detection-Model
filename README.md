## Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

The install of [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) is recommended, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 


### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Model/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook notebook.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud/downloads/creditcardfraud.zip) to be used in solving this problem is an anonymized set of credit card transactions labelled as fraudulent or genuine. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud/downloads/creditcardfraud.zip) presents transactions that occurred in two days, where there are 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud/downloads/creditcardfraud.zip).
Note: The creditcard.csv file extracted from the zip file should be in the project root directory `Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Model/`
